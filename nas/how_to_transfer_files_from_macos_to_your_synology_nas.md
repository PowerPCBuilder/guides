Start by opening Finder on your MacBook. Click on **‘Go’** in the menu bar at the top and select **‘Connect to Server’** from the dropdown menu. This option is located at the bottom of the list. This will open a new window where you can start setting up the connection to your Synology NAS.

1. In the setup window, type `smb://` followed by the IP address of your Synology NAS in the **Server Address** field.  
2. If you don’t know the IP address, visit [find.synology.com](https://find.synology.com) on your MacBook. The IP address will be displayed on the second line.  
3. To save this server for future connections, click the **+** button next to the field.
