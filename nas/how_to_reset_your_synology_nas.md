### Reset Methods Overview

1. **Soft Reset:** Restores the user account and network settings. Ideal for scenarios like forgotten passwords.  
2. **Hard Reset:** Deletes the operating system but keeps your data intact. You'll need to set up the NAS again afterward.

### Things to Keep in Mind

- Neither method will delete your data, but regular backups are always recommended to ensure safety.  
- You’ll need a pen or paperclip for the reset process.  
- Ensure the NAS is powered on. The power button's LED should be blue, and the status LED should be green.
