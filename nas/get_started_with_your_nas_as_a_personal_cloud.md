## NAS vs. Online Cloud Services

### Why Choose a NAS Over an Online Cloud?

A NAS is like an online cloud server (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) but resides in your home, giving you full control over your data. Benefits include:

- **Data Control:** You manage what to store and share.  
- **Offline Access:** Your entire media library is accessible without an internet connection.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** No monthly fees—just the upfront cost of the NAS and drives.  
- **App Integration:** Access files on your smartphone, PC, or TV through dedicated NAS apps.

### What Can You Do with a NAS as a Cloud?

A NAS personal cloud syncs files across devices, enabling seamless file access and sharing:

- **Real-Time Sync:** Upload a file on one device and edit it on another.  
- **File Sharing:** Share photos or documents instantly via download links or email.  
- **USB-Free Backup:** No need for flash drives or external hard drives—everything syncs automatically.
