# How to Make Backups of Your Files on a NAS?

A NAS is not just for media streaming—it can also function as your personal cloud for backups. From vacation photos to important business files, a NAS provides a secure storage solution. This guide explains why backups are essential and how to set them up using your NAS.

## What Is a Backup, and Why Use a NAS?

![Why make a backup of your files?](/assets/images/nas/037fd09028ef9b4d811bad4ed1787e02.jpeg)

A backup is simply a copy of your data stored on a separate drive. For instance, if your NAS or hard drive crashes, a backup ensures your files remain safe on another drive. Here’s why a NAS is ideal for backups:

- **No Subscription Costs:** Unlike cloud services, you own your NAS.  
- **Purpose-Built for Backups:** Designed for efficient and secure data storage.  
- **RAID Setup:** Protects data by mirroring or distributing files.  
- **Convenience:** Automates backup processes with minimal effort.

## Which RAID Setup Should You Use for Backups?

For secure backups, use a RAID setup. RAID allows multiple drives to work together for data protection. The most suitable RAID setups for backups are:

- **RAID 1:** Mirrors data across two drives for redundancy.  
- **RAID 5 and 6:** Use parity to restore data if a drive fails.  
- **RAID 10:** Combines mirroring and striping for performance and protection.
